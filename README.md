## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

This repository contains the **hardware** of the **ATOM Project**, a robotic arm controlled through computer vision and built using 3D printing and open-source hardware. While the overall project integrates electronics, and software, this repository focuses specifically on the mechanical and solid parts.

The repository includes all source code related to:

- ðŸ§  **Forearm, wrist and hand building**, using 3D printed pieces and electronical components.
- ðŸ“¡ **Connection with Arduino**, we'll use cable connections to communicate with the arduino board.
